# Welcome to my blog!

Hello, I'm YZBruh (Yagiz Zengin). I would like to introduce myself in the first article of my blog.
I am a 16 year old enthusiast interested in Android, Linux and open source. I know `C`, `C++`, `Make` and `Bash` languages. This blog is not personal, so there will be some different writers here too!And always improving!That's all for now friends...

And also, in this blog you will see not only technology but also gaming articles!
