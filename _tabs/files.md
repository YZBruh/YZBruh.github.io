# About File Archive
In my file archive, I have files that I will upload to this blog and to external sites. You can access everything that is/is not on the blog via my file archive.
The archive is stored safely on Google Drive.

# Access to archive
Access to the archive is open to everyone. Please report any access issues and similar problems. You can do this through the comments. I'll check it almost every day when I get a chance.
- [Archive folder link (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1imLORTO-qzcbTRJjE4-ft_zFOzRRFHF5)

# Didn't find what you were looking for?
In this case, there are two possibilities;
  - I deleted it.
  - Or there is a problem with Drive.

# Some notes
- The files in the archive have a certain order.
- The relevant file is located in the relevant folder name. For example, android-related things are located in the `Android` folder.
- Maybe I'll add a few more things :D
